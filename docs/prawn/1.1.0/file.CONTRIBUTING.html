<p>Bug reports are welcome, but please make sure to include a minimal code
sample that shows your problem. In most cases, we&#39;ll need you to give
us an example that we can actually run, so include any necessary sample
data. A screenshot or stack trace can also be helpful!</p>
</li><li>
<p>For all support requests and feature requests, please use the <a
href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/prawn-ruby">Prawn mailing
list</a> instead of the Github tracker, or see if anyone is around in
#prawn on Freenode to discuss your issue. If we find that you discovered a
bug, or that your feature request is one that we want to continue to
research and discuss on Github, we&#39;ll either ask you to file a ticket
or file one on your behalf.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Pull requests for bug fixes or enhancements are welcome. Feel free to open
them in the early stages of your work so that we can give feedback and
discuss ideas together.</p>
</li></ol>

<p>Please note that Prawn has had a rough couple of years, and so our forward
progress has slowed down quite a bit. To make it to a 1.0 release, we need
to work on just the most essential things, but our long-term goal is to
make this project as friendly to contributors as possible.</p>

<p>Here are some notes on our issue tracker process:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>We will close pull requests that need revisions, after tagging them with a
"needs-revision" tag. Once the revisions are made, you can comment on the
pull request and we&#39;ll review it again.</p>
</li><li>
<p>We may close any issue after 30 days of inactivity, labeling it with a
&#39;stale&#39; tag. To re-open it, simply leave a comment on the issue. If
there is a proper example in place and the issue still is relevant, we will
open it back up.</p>
</li><li>
<p>We will close all incoming issues related to the currently unmaintained
templates feature, marking them with a &#39;templates&#39; tag. These will
remained archived in our tracker until someone else starts maintaining
prawn-templates, but we cannot provide any help for this unsupported
feature at this point in time.</p>
</li></ul>

<p>These are all temporary measures, and will be revised once we hit 1.0. The
underlying goal is to keep the issue tracker full of actionable issues that
we can respond to in a timely fashion, not to sweep unresolved issues under
the rug!</p>

<p>Thanks for your patience, and happy Prawning.</p>
