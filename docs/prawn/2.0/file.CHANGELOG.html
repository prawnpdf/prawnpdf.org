<h3 id="label-Gradients+applied+inside+transformations+are+now+correctly+positioned">Gradients applied inside transformations are now correctly positioned</h3>

<p>PDF gradients/patterns take coordinates in the coordinate space of the
document, not the “user space”, so if you performed a
scale/rotate/translate and then painted a gradient inside, it wasn&#39;t
correctly positioned.</p>

<p>This change tracks transformations applied to the document, and multiplies
the gradient matrix with this tracked transformation matrix so that the
gradient appears in the correct place in the document.</p>

<p>Because this changes how the x and y coordinates are interpreted, you must
manually add <code>apply_transformations: true</code> to your
<code>stroke_gradient</code> and <code>fill_gradient</code> calls to use
the fixed behaviour in Prawn 2. It is expected that this will be the
default in Prawn 3.</p>

<p>Please <a
href="https://github.com/prawnpdf/prawn/wiki/Gradient-Transformations">refer
to the wiki page on this change</a> for more information.</p>

<p>Blend modes can be used to change the way two layers are blended together.
The BM key is added to the External Graphics State based on the v1.4 PDF
spec. <code>blend_mode</code> accepts a single blend mode or array of blend
modes. If an array is passed, the PDF viewer blends layers based on the
first valid blend mode.</p>

<p>Previously, url links were not clickable when rendered within a stamp. The

stamp is called, thereby generating a clickable link in the pdf.</p>

<p>Because repeaters are built upon stamps, this fix should also solve issues
with links inside of repeaters.</p>

<h3 id="label-Fix+regression+in+draw_text-28-29+with+rotation">Fix regression in draw_text() with rotation</h3>

<p>Due to missing tests, a typo snuck into the <code>draw_text()</code> method
in PDF::Core, preventing it from working properly when called with the
<code>:rotate</code> option.</p>

<p>This issue has been resolved, and a test has been added to Prawn&#39;s test
suite. Speaking more generally, we need to improve the condition of the
tests for <code>PDF::Core</code>, and make a clear separation between
Prawn&#39;s test suite and PDF::Core&#39;s tests. Currently there are lots
of little gaps that can lead to this sort of problem.</p>

<h2 id="label-PrawnPDF+2.0.0+--+2015-02-26">PrawnPDF 2.0.0 – 2015-02-26</h2>

<h3 id="label-Changes+to+supported+Ruby+versions">Changes to supported Ruby versions</h3>

<p>Now that Ruby 1.9.3 is no longer supported by the Ruby core team, Prawn
will no longer attempt to maintain 1.9.x compatibility.</p>

<p>We will continue to support Ruby 2.0.0 and 2.1.x, and have added support
for Ruby 2.2.x as well.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re using JRuby, we recommend using JRuby 1.7.x (&gt;= 1.7.18) in
2.0 mode for now. Please file bug reports if you run into any problems!</p>

<h3 id="label-Changes+to+PrawnPDF-27s+versioning+policies">Changes to PrawnPDF&#39;s versioning policies</h3>

<p>Starting with this release, we will set version numbers based on the
following policy:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Whenever a documented feature is modified in a backwards-incompatible way,
we&#39;ll bump our major version number.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Whenever we add new functionality without breaking backwards compatibility,
we&#39;ll bump our minor version number.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Whenever we cut maintenance releases (which cover only bug fixes,
documentation, and internal improvements), we&#39;ll bump our tiny version
number.</p>
</li></ul>

<p>This policy is similar in spirit to <a href="http://semver.org/">Semantic
Versioning</a>, and we may end up formally adopting SemVer in the future.</p>

<p>The main caveat is that if a feature is not documented (either in our API
documentation or in Prawn&#39;s manual), you cannot assume anything about
its intended behavior. Prawn has a lot of cruft left in it due to piecewise
development over nearly a decade, so the APIs have not been designed as
much as they have been organically grown.</p>

<p>To make sure that the amount of undefined behavior in Prawn shrinks over
time, we&#39;ll make sure to review and revise documentation whenever new
functionality is added, and also whenever we change existing features.</p>

<h3 id="label-All+decimals+in+PDF+output+are+now+rounded+to+a+fixed+precision+of+4+decimal+places">All decimals in PDF output are now rounded to a fixed precision of 4 decimal places</h3>

<p>This should improve compatibility across viewers that do not support
arbitrarily long decimal numbers, without effecting practical use at all.
(A PDF point is 1/72 inch, so 0.0001 PDF point is a very, very small
number).</p>

<p>This patch was added in response to certain PDFs on certain versions of
Adobe Reader raising errors when viewed.</p>

<h3 id="label-Fixed+text+width+calculation+to+prevent+unnecessary+soft+hyphen">Fixed text width calculation to prevent unnecessary soft hyphen</h3>

<p>Previously, the <code>width_of</code> method would include the width of all
soft hyphens in a string, regardless of whether they would be rendered or
not. This caused lines of text to appear longer than they actually were,
causing unnecessary wrapping and hyphenation at times.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve changed this calculation to only include the width of a soft
hyphen when it will actually be rendered (i.e. when a line needs to be
wrapped), which should prevent unnecessary hyphenation and text wrapping in
strings containing soft hyphens.</p>

href="https://github.com/prawnpdf/prawn/issues/775">#775</a>, <a
href="https://github.com/prawnpdf/prawn/pull/786">#786</a>)</p>

<h3 id="label-Fixed+styled+text+width+calculations+when+using+TTF+files">Fixed styled text width calculations when using TTF files</h3>

<p>Previously, <code>width_of</code> calculations on styled text were relying
on the document font&#39;s name attribute in order to look up the
appropriate font style. This doesn&#39;t work for TTF fonts, since the name
is a full path to a single style of font, and the Prawn must know about the
font family in order to find another style.</p>

<p>The <code>width_of</code> method has been updated to use the font family
instead, allowing calculations to work properly with TTFs.</p>

<p>(Ernie Miller, <a
href="https://github.com/prawnpdf/prawn/pull/827">#827</a>)</p>

<h3 id="label-Fixed+broken+vertical+alignment+for+center+and+bottom">Fixed broken vertical alignment for center and bottom</h3>

<p>In earlier versions of Prawn, center alignment and bottom alignment in text
boxes worked in a way that is inconsistent with common typographical
conventions:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Vertically centered text was padded so that the distance between the top of
the box and the ascender of the first line of text was made equal to the
distance between the descender of the bottom line to the descender of the
last line of text.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Bottom aligned text included the line gap specified by a font, leaving a
bit of extra in the box space below the descender of the last line of text.</p>
</li></ul>

<p>Other commonly used software typically uses the baseline rather than the
descender when centering text, and does not include the line gap when
bottom aligning text. We&#39;ve changed Prawn&#39;s behavior to be
consistent with those conventions, which should result in less surprising
output.</p>

<p>That said, this problem has existed in Prawn for a very, very long time.
Check your code to see if you&#39;ve been working around this issue,
because if so it may cause breakage.</p>

href="https://github.com/prawnpdf/prawn/issues/169">#169</a>.</p>

<h3 id="label-Calling+dash-280-29+now+raises+an+error+instead+of+generating+a+corrupt+PDF">Calling dash(0) now raises an error instead of generating a corrupt PDF</h3>

<p>In earlier versions of Prawn, accidentally calling <code>dash(0)</code>
instead of <code>undash</code> in an attempt to clear dash settings would
generate a corrupted document instead of raising an error, making debugging
difficult.</p>

<p>Because <code>dash(0)</code> is not a valid API call, we now raise an error
that says “Zero length dashes are invalid. Call #undash to disable
dashes.”, making the source of the problem much clearer.</p>

<h3 id="label-Vastly+improved+handling+of+encodings+for+PDF+built+in+-28AFM-29+fonts">Vastly improved handling of encodings for PDF built in (AFM) fonts</h3>

<p>Prawn has always had comprehensive UTF-8 support for TTF font files, but
many users still rely on the “built in” AFM fonts that are provided by PDF
viewers. These fonts only support the very limited set of internationalized
characters specified by the Windows-1252 character encoding, and that has
been a long standing source of confusion and awkward behaviors.</p>

<p>Earlier versions of Prawn attempted to transcode UTF-8 to Windows-1252
automatically, but some of our low level features either assumed that text
was already encoded properly, or returned text in a different encoding than
what was provided because of the internal transcoding operations. We also
handled Windows-1252 encoding manually, so strings would come back tagged
as ASCII-8BIT instead of Windows-1252, making things even more confusing.</p>

<p>In this release, we&#39;ve made some major behavior changes to the way AFM
fonts work so that users need to think less about Prawn&#39;s internals:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Text handling for all public Prawn methods is now UTF-8-in, UTF-8-out,
making Windows-1252 transcoding purely an implementation detail of Prawn
that isn&#39;t visible from the outside.</p>
</li><li>
<p>When using AFM fonts + non-ASCII characters that are NOT supported in
Windows-1252, an exception will be raised rather than replacing w. 
<code>_</code>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>When using AFM fonts + non-ASCII characters that are supported in 
Windows-1252, users will see a warning about the limited
internationalization support, along with a recommendation to use a TTF 
font instead.</p>
</li><li>
<p>The warning includes instructions on how to disable it (just set
<code>Prawn::Font::AFM.hide_m17_warning = true</code>)</p>
</li><li>
<p>When using AFM fonts + ASCII only text, no warning will be seen.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Internally, we&#39;re now using Ruby&#39;s M17n system to handle the
encoding into Windows-1252, so text.encoding will come back as Windows-1252
when <code>AFM#normalize_encoding</code> is called, rather than
<code>ASCII-8Bit</code></p>
</li></ul>

<p>None of the above issues apply when using TTF fonts with Prawn, because
those have always been UTF-8 in, UTF-8 out, and no transcoding was done
internally. It is still our recommendation for those using
internationalized text to use TTF fonts because they do not have the same
limitations as AFM fonts, but those who need to use AFM for whatever reason
should benefit greatly from these changes.</p>

<h3 id="label-Temporarily+restored+the+Document-23on_page_create+method">Temporarily restored the Document#on_page_create method</h3>

<p>This method was moved into PDF::Core in the Prawn 1.3.0 release, removing
it from the <code>Prawn::Document</code> API. Although it is a low-level
method not meant for general use, it is necessary for certain tasks that we
do not have proper support for elsewhere.</p>

<p>This method should still be considered part of Prawn&#39;s internals and is
subject to change at any time, but we have restored it temporarily until we
have a suitable replacement for it. See the discussion on <a
href="https://github.com/prawnpdf/prawn/issues/797">#797</a> for more
details.</p>

<h3 id="label-Added+the+Prawn-3A-3AView+mixin+for+using+Prawn-27s+DSL+in+your+own+classes.">Added the Prawn::View mixin for using Prawn&#39;s DSL in your own classes.</h3>

<p>In complex Prawn-based documents, it is a common pattern to create
subclasses of <code>Prawn::Document</code> to isolate different components
from one another, or to provide some customized rendering methods. However,
the sprawling nature of the <code>Prawn::Document</code> object makes this
an unsafe practice: it implements hundreds of methods and contains dozens
of instance variables, all of which can conflict with any subclass
functionality.</p>

<p><code>Prawn::View</code> provides a safer alternative by using object
composition instead of inheritance. This will keep your state and methods
separate from Prawn&#39;s internals, while still allowing you to directly
call any methods provided by the <code>Prawn::Document</code> object.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s an example of <code>Prawn::View</code> in use:</p>

way down to fit on a single unbroken line.</p>

<p>To maintain backwards compatibility, <code>:disable_wrap_by_char</code> is
implemented as an optional behavior that is off by default.</p>

<h3 id="label-Fallback+fonts+no+longer+break+global+font+styling.">Fallback fonts no longer break global font styling.</h3>

<p>In earlier versions of Prawn, using the fallback font system caused styling
information (i.e. bold, italic) for all fonts to be lost, and the only
workaround to this problem was to specify style explicitly for each
individual text fragment.</p>

<p>Now that this issue has been resolved, it is safe to use the
<code>font</code> method to set styles globally, even if fallback fonts are
in use.</p>

<h3 id="label-Formatted+text+box+dry+runs+no+longer+modify+graphics+state">Formatted text box dry runs no longer modify graphics state</h3>

<p>Dry runs are supposed to be a side-effect-free way of simulating text
rendering, but a bug in earlier versions of Prawn caused the graphics state
to be modified if colors were set on text fragments. This patch resolves
that issue.</p>

<h3 id="label-Fixed+manual+build+failure+on+Ruby+1.9.3">Fixed manual build failure on Ruby 1.9.3</h3>

<p>When we extracted Prawn::ManualBuilder, we accidentally broke its support
for Ruby 1.9.3. That issue has been resolved, and a new version of the
<code>prawn-manual_builder</code> gem has been released.</p>

<h3 id="label-Table+support+now+disabled+by+default-2C+moving+to+its+own+gem+soon.">Table support now disabled by default, moving to its own gem soon.</h3>

<p>We&#39;re planning to extract table generation into its own semi-officially
supported gem in a future release. Until then, you can use the following
line to enable table support in your projects:</p>

<pre class="code ruby"><code class="ruby"><span class='id identifier rubyid_require'>require</span> <span class='tstring'><span class='tstring_beg'>&quot;</span><span class='tstring_content'>prawn/table</span><span class='tstring_end'>&quot;</span></span>
</code></pre>

<p>As of right now tables are still supported as an experimental public
feature – we only disabled it by default to make sure people are aware that
it will be extracted into its own gem soon.</p>

<h3 id="label-I-2FO+objects+are+now+supported+in+the+font+system.">I/O objects are now supported in the font system.</h3>

<p>You can now pass a fully formed Prawn::Font object in addition to a file
path when adding a font family to your document.
<code>Prawn::Font.load</code> now also accepts IO object as an alternative
to explicitly specifying a path on the filesystem. For example:</p>

<h3 id="label-We+now+use+the+Prawn-3A-3AManualBuilder+gem+to+generate+our+documentation.">We now use the Prawn::ManualBuilder gem to generate our documentation.</h3>

<p>In previous releases, the system that generated Prawn&#39;s manual was
bundled directly with Prawn and not usable by third party extensions.
We&#39;ve now extracted that system into <a
href="https://github.com/prawnpdf/prawn-manual_builder">its own project</a>
so that it can be used by anyone who wants to ship PDF-based documentation
for their Prawn code.</p>

<p><code>Prawn::ManualBuilder</code> is still a bit rough around the edges
because it wasn&#39;t originally meant for general purpose use, but
extracting out the code is an important first step in making it more useful
for everyone. Bug fixes and improvements are welcome!</p>

<p>Orphaned header rows look bad and could be considered a rendering bug, and
so this change fixes that problem by making sure there is enough room for
at least one row of non-header data before attempting to render headers.</p>

incorrectly in multi-page tables. This bug has now been fixed.</p>

<h3 id="label-Margins+are+now+properly+restored+after+a+multi-page+bounding+box+is+rendered.">Margins are now properly restored after a multi-page bounding box is rendered.</h3>

<p>In a Prawn document, it&#39;s possible to reset the page margins on each
newly created page: i.e. <code>@doc.start_new_page(:margin =&gt;
64)</code>. But due to a very old bug, this feature did not work correctly
any time that a bounding box spanned more than one page.</p>

<p>Because many of Prawn&#39;s features rely on bounding boxes internally,
this problem typically would reveal itself indirectly. This example from
Malte Schmitz helped us finally track down the problem:</p>

<pre class="code ruby"><code class="ruby"><span class='id identifier rubyid_pdf'>pdf</span> <span class='op'>=</span> <span class='const'>Prawn</span><span class='op'>::</span><span class='const'>Document</span><span class='period'>.</span><span class='id identifier rubyid_new'>new</span><span class='lparen'>(</span><span class='symbol'>:margin</span> <span class='op'>=&gt;</span> <span class='int'>200</span><span class='rparen'>)</span>

</code></pre>

<p>The root cause of this problem has been found and fixed, and there should
no longer be unexpected issues when using the <code>:margin</code>
parameter to <code>start_new_page</code>.</p>

<h3 id="label-Transaction+support+has+been+removed+from+Prawn-2C+and+the+Document-23group+feature+has+been+temporarily+disabled.">Transaction support has been removed from Prawn, and the Document#group feature has been temporarily disabled.</h3>

<p>We&#39;ve discovered some very serious flaws in Prawn&#39;s transaction
support which can easily cause documents to become corrupted. The only
thing transactions were used internally for in Prawn was to support the
<code>Document#group</code> feature, but the underlying defects were severe
enough to make <code>Document#group</code> unsafe for use whenever a page
boundary is crossed.</p>

<p>We&#39;d like to bring back both transactions and grouping functionality,
but it&#39;s going to involve some major work to do so cleanly. Until that
happens, we&#39;ve decided its better not to provide the feature at all
than it is to have folks try to use something that will likely result in
hard to hunt down bugs.</p>

<p>An experiment to restore grouping functionality without relying on
transactions has already been released by Daniel Dengler in the <a
href="https://github.com/ddengler/prawn-grouping">prawn-grouping</a>
extension, so you may want to give that a try if you need grouping
functionality.</p>

<h3 id="label-Fixed+broken+git+clone+of+Prawn+repository+for+Windows">Fixed broken git clone of Prawn repository for Windows</h3>

<p>A useless file named <code>..</code> was accidentally checked into the

file has been removed, resolving the problem.</p>

our outline support ended going along with it. That was accidental, and so
we&#39;ve now restored Prawn::Outline and marked it as part of our stable
API.</p>
